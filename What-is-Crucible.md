MythicCrucible is the ultimate item add-on for Mythic!

It allows you to create:
- Custom items
- Custom armor
- Custom blocks
- "Furniture" / placeable objects
- Crafting recipes
- ...and more!

All of these can use any Mythic skills, stats, conditions, most triggers (including new triggers specifically for items), and many new special options!

Crucible also comes with a powerful resource pack generator, allowing you to easily add custom models and sounds to your items - even armor, without Optifine - and can be generated directly from `.bbmodel` files.
