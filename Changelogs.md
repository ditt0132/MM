2.0.0 
=====

Because of the size of this update, this changelog only includes a brief overview. More information is available throughout the wiki.

- Added `Pack Generation` - You can now auto-generate countless things into a tidy pack - items, blocks, furniture, spell effects/bullets, unicode images, sounds, and more. We've gone above and beyond to support any format for this - including just throwing the .bbmodel file in just like MEG (the recommended method). Not only that, but there are many options to edit the item during generation, such as mutating the color to make variants.
- Added `Custom Armor` - Added the ability to add custom armor without shaders. Sacrificing 1 armor type (such as chainmail) opens the door to unlimited custom armor types via trims.
- Added `Item Stats` - Items fully support the entire Mythic stat system. Did you know Mythic comes with tons of custom stats, like the good oldies such as Critical Strike? Or that you can make your own custom stats in highly flexible ways? Mythic item stats are fully compatible with stats on mobs, auras, RPG, and everything in our ecosystem - the ability to have cross-system interactions is here.
- Added `Crafting Conditions & Skills` - Crafts now support Mythic conditions and skills!
- Added `Lore Templates` - Creating templates for your lore that use placeholders, so you can keep a consistent look across your custom items!
- Added `NBT Mechanics & Conditions` - Self explanatory
- Added `Hats` - Hats!
- Added `Paint Brush` item type
