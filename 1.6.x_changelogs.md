Furniture
---------
### Display Entities (1.19.4+)
- Added support for DisplayEntity furniture with Furniture.Type option 
- All display options are also usable in furniture states
```
  Furniture:
    Type: DISPLAY
    Scale: 0.5,0.5,0.5 (size of the model, defaults to 0.5 to match itemframe sizing)
    Transform: [FIXED/HEAD/GROUND/GUI/LEFT_HAND/RIGHT_HAND, defaults to FIXED]
    Billboard: [FIXED/CENTER/VERTICAL/HORIZONTAL]
    Brightness: [brightness]
    InterpolationDelay: [delay before beginning interpolation]
    InterpolationDuration: [seconds to interpolate scaling over]
```
Type will default to DISPLAY on 1.19.4+ and ITEM_FRAME on earlier versions. DISPLAY should be backwards compatible with the default options. 

Old furniture should continue to work as normally and will auto-convert types if moved. 

If you're using ViaBackwards and can't use Display entities, set `Configuration.Furniture.DefaultType: ITEM_FRAME` in your config.yml

### Hitboxes (1.19.4+)
- Added hitbox support for furniture on 1.19.4+ using Interaction Entities.
```
Chair:
  Furniture:
    Hitbox:
      Height: 1
      Width: 1
```
Defaults to 1x1 if the furniture has no barriers, or 0 if it does.
